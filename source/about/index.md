**Hi,**

This is **Yingbiao**,an NLP engineer who dreaming to build a robot that can chip chat with me in gaming when I solo queue(*yep, I am a bronze level LOL Top lane player*).

I started my journy with NLP since I was doing my undergraduate thesis. NLP + Machine Learning is such an area of magic, I put my full passion to it, feeling that I found my wonderland!

In this blog, I will share my ideas about **NLP** and **deep learning**.
Please feel free to leave comments, **I like sharing and making friends^-^.**


Anyway, here are my friends, we share many happy memories, they are so cool!
